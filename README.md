# Movie-Recommendation-System
Overview
This repository contains a movie recommendation algorithm that utilizes TF-IDF Vectorizer and Cosine Similarity. The algorithm suggests movies based on their textual features, providing a personalized and relevant movie list for users.

## Tools Used
- Python: The programming language used for developing the recommendation algorithm.
- scikit-learn: The machine learning library used for implementing the TF-IDF Vectorizer and calculating Cosine Similarity.
- Pandas: Used for data manipulation and handling.
- NumPy: Used for numerical operations.
## Procedure
### Dataset
Ensure you have a dataset containing information about movies, including textual features like genres, or any relevant text data.

### Data Preprocessing
Clean and preprocess the text data to remove any noise, irrelevant information, or special characters. Tokenize the text and remove stopwords to enhance the quality of TF-IDF vectors.

### TF-IDF Vectorization
Use the TfidfVectorizer from scikit-learn to convert the preprocessed text data into TF-IDF vectors. This step represents each movie as a vector in a high-dimensional space, capturing the importance of words in the document.

### Cosine Similarity Calculation
Calculate the cosine similarity between movies using the TF-IDF vectors. The cosine similarity score measures the similarity between two vectors in the vector space.

### Movie Recommendation
Implement a function that takes a movie title as input and returns a list of recommended movies based on their cosine similarity scores.

### Usage
Run the recommendation function with a movie title to get personalized movie suggestions.
